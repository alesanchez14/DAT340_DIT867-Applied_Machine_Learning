-1/0,"The crab served had a foul smell, like ammonia. The waiter was polite, and recognized the smell. He said that he could replace the crab’s portion with the smell, but has also said that there’s no way ammonia could have touched that crab, what he meant by that we are not so sure about it. The crab’s shell was also rubbery, making it difficult to break it.Rest of food was good, though, but nothing special.",the crab served had foul smell like ammonia the waiter wa polite and recognized the smell he said that he could replace the crab portion with the smell but ha also said that there no way ammonia could have touched that crab what he meant by that we are not so sure about it the crab shell wa also rubbery making it difficult to break it rest of food wa good though but nothing special,-1,0,0
